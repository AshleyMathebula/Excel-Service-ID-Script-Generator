Detailed Explanation
🎯 Purpose of the Script

main.py is the interactive command-line interface (CLI) that controls the workflow of an Excel-driven script generator.
It connects three major utility components:

ExcelHandler → Reads and filters Excel data.

FileWriter → Writes processed results to .txt files.

Logger → Tracks every action for debugging and audit.

This design separates concerns:

The main script handles user interaction and workflow.

Utilities handle specialized logic (I/O, Excel reading, logging).

📚 Imported Libraries
Library	Role
pathlib.Path	Provides OS-independent file path operations (safer than string paths).
typing.List	Enables static type hints for lists (improves clarity and IDE support).
utils.excel_handler	Custom module that reads Excel sheets and extracts matching codes.
utils.file_writer	Custom module that saves text files safely and handles directory creation.
utils.logger	Centralized logger for consistent output to both file and console.


⚙️ Key Python & OOP Concepts
1. Encapsulation

Each utility (ExcelHandler, FileWriter, Logger) encapsulates its own logic:

The main script doesn’t care how Excel reading or file writing works internally.

It just uses the class interfaces — a hallmark of encapsulation.

2. Composition

Rather than inheritance, the main function composes its logic using these utilities:

handler = ExcelHandler(str(excel_file))
writer = FileWriter(output_dir="output")


This is an example of composition over inheritance, improving modularity.

3. Error Handling

The try...except block around the entire process ensures robust error capture.
If anything fails (e.g., file not found, invalid input), the logger records it, and the user sees a friendly message.

4. Type Hinting

Throughout the code, functions declare expected types like:

def display_menu(options: List[str]) -> None:


This improves readability, IDE autocompletion, and maintainability.

5. Entry Point Guard

The Pythonic idiom:

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()


prevents accidental execution when importing main.py as a module — ensuring it only runs as a standalone CLI.

6. Logging

Instead of print statements, the program uses structured logs:

logger.info("Selected sheets: %s", selected_sheets)


This supports traceability and debugging without cluttering console output.

7. List Comprehensions

Used for compact parsing:

ids = [s.strip() for s in raw.split(",") if s.strip()]


This is both efficient and readable.
