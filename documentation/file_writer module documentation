Detailed Explanation
ðŸ”¹ Purpose

This module provides a lightweight abstraction for file writing.
Itâ€™s typically used after processing data (like Excel sheets or logs) to safely export results to disk â€” for example,
saving formatted configuration lines or reports generated by other utilities.

It ensures:

The output folder always exists.

Files are written cleanly in UTF-8 encoding.

File creation is logged for traceability.

ðŸ”¹ Libraries Used
Library	Description
pathlib	Built-in Python library for working with filesystem paths in an object-oriented, cross-platform way.
Replaces os.path for cleaner syntax (Path.mkdir(), Path.write_text(), etc.).
typing.Iterable	Provides type hints, making the function signatures clearer (lines: Iterable[str]).
utils.logger	Custom logger utility for structured logging. Likely wraps Pythonâ€™s logging module for consistent
formatting and log levels across all utilities.


ðŸ”¹ OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) Concepts
Concept	How It Appears
Class (FileWriter)	Encapsulates file writing logic. Keeps configuration (output_dir) inside an instance.
Encapsulation	File creation, path management, and logging are hidden behind clean, public methods.
Constructor (__init__)	Automatically ensures the directory exists and logs initialization details.
Single Responsibility Principle	The class has only one clear job â€” to manage writing text files.
Abstraction	The user doesnâ€™t deal with os.makedirs or manual encoding â€” everything is handled inside FileWriter.

This design supports testability and reusability â€” different parts of the project can safely use this class without
worrying about directories or exceptions.

ðŸ”¹ Python Concepts Demonstrated
Concept	Explanation
Pathlib over os.path	Modern, cleaner, and cross-platform-safe for filesystem operations.
Type Hinting	Improves readability and IDE auto-completion (Iterable[str], Path).
Exception Handling	Uses try/except to handle unexpected I/O errors and logs them properly.
Logging	Provides traceable logs for debugging or auditing.
String Joining	Uses "\n".join(lines) to efficiently combine list elements into file content.
Conditional Expression	Adds a trailing newline only if lines exist.
Return Value	Returns the resolved absolute Path so that callers can use it in follow-up operations.


ðŸ§© Summary

Purpose: Central utility for writing text-based outputs to disk safely.

Key Features: Auto-creates directories, UTF-8 writing, and detailed logging.

Design: Follows OOP best practices â€” clean, encapsulated, and single-responsibility.

Usage: Ideal companion to other modules (like ExcelHandler) that generate output lines for export.
