Detailed Explanation
üîπ Purpose

This module (excel_handler.py) automates the process of:

Reading structured Excel files (like service configuration sheets).

Searching for specific Service_IDs.

Extracting associated numbers or codes (from sub-identifier columns).

Cleaning and formatting those codes into standardized action line outputs.

It helps engineers or automation scripts convert messy Excel data into ready-to-use configuration lines.

üîπ Libraries Used
Library	Purpose
pandas	Provides high-performance data structures (DataFrame) for reading and manipulating Excel data.
openpyxl	Acts as the engine used by pandas to read .xlsx Excel files.
typing (List, Iterable)	Provides type hints for better readability and static analysis.
utils.logger	A custom logging utility (likely wrapping Python‚Äôs logging module) to record events, errors, and operations.


üîπ OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) Concepts
Concept	How It Appears in Code
Class	The ExcelHandler class encapsulates all Excel-related logic.
Encapsulation	The class hides implementation details (like pandas parsing) behind clean public methods (sheet_names, find_service_codes, etc.).
Abstraction	The caller doesn‚Äôt need to know how pandas works ‚Äî they just call find_service_codes() to get results.
Static Methods	clean_codes() and format_action_lines() don‚Äôt depend on instance state, so they‚Äôre marked @staticmethod.
Constructor (__init__)	Initializes and validates the Excel file once, caching data for later reuse.
Composition	The class uses a pandas.ExcelFile object internally as part of its behavior.


üîπ Other Python Concepts
Concept	Description
Exception Handling	try/except blocks handle file reading errors and log them gracefully.
Logging	Uses a structured logging approach (logger.info, logger.warning, logger.exception).
List Comprehensions & Generators	Used to find columns dynamically (next((c for c in df.columns if ...), None)).
Type Hinting	Improves code clarity and IDE support.
Functional Programming	Use of map-like iteration patterns (e.g., for raw in codes:).
String Manipulation	For normalizing, cleaning, and formatting text data efficiently.

‚öôÔ∏è How It Fits in a Project

In a larger automation system (e.g., SMS routing, telecom provisioning, or configuration management), this class could be used as follows:

Input: An Excel file like MO_Connection_Database.xlsx containing multiple services and phone codes.

Process:

Instantiate ExcelHandler("data/MO_Connection_Database.xlsx")

For each service, run find_service_codes(sheet, service_id)

Clean codes with clean_codes()

Format with format_action_lines()

Output: A ready-to-export text or config file used by another system or script.

üß© Summary

Purpose: Automate Excel data extraction and conversion to configuration lines.

Design: Object-oriented, modular, and reusable.

Strengths:

Case-insensitive search

Robust error handling

Clean separation of responsibilities

Readable, testable methods
